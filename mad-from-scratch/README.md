# mad-from-scratch
This repository is a series of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science algorithms built from scratch as a learning experience.

The following algorithms are implemented in Python:

- Supervised Learning
	- Linear regression
- Markov Decission Precoss (MDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
	- Basics of MDP (grid world)
	- Policy Iteration
	- Value Iteration
	- Model-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP)
	- Model-free Monte Carlo (MC)
	- Q-Learning
